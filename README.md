# Scripts
A collection of scripts I use to accomplish various tasks, most often downloading/scraping content
## Overview
### Scripts
- `www.readm.org.py` - A cli python script that scrapes [readm.org](https://readm.org/) to download manga.
- `www1.myasiantv.cc.py` - A cli python script that uses Selenium to scrape and download episodes from [myasiantv.cc](https://myasiantv.cc/).
- `wfetch.ps1` - a very minimal neofetch for powershell that shows: CPU, GPU, PS Version, Uptime, RAM Usage
## Installation
Each script has instructions commented inside about usage.
